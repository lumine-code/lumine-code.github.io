# Services

Packages extend one another through **services**: one package offers an object, another receives it. Nothing is imported across package boundaries and neither side needs the other installed — if the provider is missing, the consumer's method simply never runs.

## How it works

A provider declares what it offers in its `package.json`:

```json
{
  "providedServices": {
    "status-bar": {
      "versions": { "1.0.0": "provideStatusBar" }
    }
  }
}
```

A consumer declares what it wants, with a semver range:

```json
{
  "consumedServices": {
    "status-bar": {
      "versions": { "^1.0.0": "consumeStatusBar" }
    }
  }
}
```

Both then export the named method. The provider's returns the service object; the consumer's receives it, once per matching provider:

```js
module.exports = {
  provideStatusBar() {
    return { addLeftTile, addRightTile };
  },
};
```

```js
module.exports = {
  consumeStatusBar(service) {
    this.statusBar = service;
    return new Disposable(() => (this.statusBar = null));
  },
};
```

Return a `Disposable` from a consumer method and Lumine calls it when the provider goes away, so a package can cleanly drop a service it is no longer being offered.

Order does not matter. Lumine connects providers and consumers whichever activates first, and connects late arrivals as they load.

### Bootstrap and lazy work

Packages bootstrap synchronously. A provider publishes its declared service during `activate()`, and a consumer connects to providers that are already available; consuming a service never activates another package. Keep expensive provider implementation behind an `ensure` function or an asynchronous service method, and let the consumer await that method when it performs the operation.

### Names are matched exactly

A service name is an opaque string. The `.` in `linter.provider` groups related services for a reader — it is **not** a path, so consuming `linter` does not reach a provider of `linter.provider`. Get the name exactly right or nothing happens: there is no error, no warning in the console, and no failing spec. Missing wiring is silent.

### Versions

Service versions follow semver. A provider declares exact versions and a consumer requests the range it implements; use `^1.0.0`, `^1.1.0`, `^2.0.0`, or another range according to the service's canonical contract. Add compatible capabilities in a minor release and use a new major version for an incompatible shape; rename the service only when its meaning or ownership changes.

## Naming

If you are designing a service rather than consuming one, follow the workspace naming convention.

A name is either bare or `namespace.capability`, both kebab-case:

- **Bare, your package's name**, when your package offers exactly one contract and that contract is it handing out its own thing — `status-bar`, `terminal`, `pdf-view`.
- **`namespace.capability`** when your package offers two or more contracts, or when a bare name would not say what crosses the boundary. The usual case is a hub collecting plugins: the namespace belongs to the hub even though the hub is the _consumer_, so `spell-check` provides `linter.provider`. The tell is who declares `providedServices` — if that is you and you are handing out your own API, go bare.
- The namespace is a **general domain rather than a package name** when more than one package could reasonably implement the contract. `icons.provider` has two providers and belongs to neither; `symbol.document-provider` is shared by document symbol sources. Drop a `-view`/`-panel` suffix when a real domain word remains, keep it when none does — hence `outline.provider` but `tree-view.selection`.

The method is `provide`/`consume` plus the PascalCased name, dropping a trailing `provider` segment because the verb already says it: `linter.provider` → `provideLinter`, `icons.provider` → `provideIcons`.

## Contracts

Each service's canonical contract belongs in the repository of the package that owns it, normally as `docs/<service-name>.md` and, for core services, under `lumine/docs/services/`. This keeps the shape, required fields and example beside the implementation. The editor exposes package documentation under Settings → the package → Documentation.

## Contextual help

`documentation-view` owns the context-help domain. Sources provide [`context-help.provider`](https://github.com/lumine-code/documentation-view/blob/master/docs/context-help.provider.md); views consume [`context-help.registry`](https://github.com/lumine-code/documentation-view/blob/master/docs/context-help.registry.md) to request and render combined answers. A view can also consume [`context-help.panel`](https://github.com/lumine-code/documentation-view/blob/master/docs/context-help.panel.md) to open its existing answer in the documentation dock without another provider request.

Providers implement `getHelp(editor, position, {signal})` and optionally `getGutterHelp(editor, row, {signal})`. Each call owns its cancellation state so a tooltip request cannot cancel a simultaneous panel request. Custom content returns a `render()` factory that creates fresh DOM, with an optional disposer, for each surface. Consumers dispose their own rendering when it closes.

This replaces `hover.provider` during preproduction. Migrate providers and consumers directly to the context-help contracts; there are no compatibility aliases. `hover.signature-provider` remains the independent contract for function signature help.

## Jupyter integrations

The nine Jupyter packages share kernel sessions, explicit editor contexts, owned asynchronous requests, execution receipts, and canonical output rendering. See [Jupyter services and lifecycle](jupyter-services.md) for package responsibilities and teardown rules.
