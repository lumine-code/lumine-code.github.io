# Tree-sitter grammars

Each bundled Tree-sitter grammar combines three things: a **pre-built parser** compiled from an upstream `tree-sitter-*` repository into a `.wasm` file, **query files** with the `.scm` extension that turn syntax nodes into scopes, and a **grammar config** in `.json` that ties them together. This page covers how those pieces fit and how to build, update, and validate them in a Lumine source checkout.

Install [`language-tree-sitter-query`](https://github.com/lumine-code/language-tree-sitter-query) from **Settings → Install** or with `lumine --install lumine-code/language-tree-sitter-query` to edit `.scm` query files with syntax highlighting, folding, indentation, and symbols. These files use Tree-sitter's query syntax, which resembles Scheme but describes parser nodes, captures, and predicates.

## The grammar config

A Tree-sitter grammar config and all of its runtime assets live directly in a package's flat `grammars/` directory. Filenames describe the language or variant without repeating the `tree-sitter-` implementation prefix: `python.json`, `python.wasm`, `python-highlights.scm`.

```json
{
  "name": "JSON",
  "scopeName": "source.json",
  "type": "tree-sitter",
  "treeSitter": {
    "parserSource": "github:tree-sitter/tree-sitter-json#v0.24.8",
    "wasmBuildTool": "tree-sitter-cli#v0.27.0",
    "grammar": "json.wasm",
    "highlightsQuery": [
      "json-no-comments-highlights.scm",
      "json-highlights.scm"
    ],
    "indentsQuery": "json-indents.scm",
    "foldsQuery": "json-folds.scm"
  }
}
```

- **`parserSource`** pins the exact upstream source as `github:org/repo#ref`, where `ref` is a tag or a full commit SHA — never a moving branch, so a build is always reproducible. For repositories that contain several grammars, add the subdirectory: `github:tree-sitter-grammars/tree-sitter-markdown/tree-sitter-markdown-inline#<ref>`.
- **`wasmBuildTool`** records which `tree-sitter-cli` version built the committed wasm. It is provenance, not configuration.
- **`grammar`** points at the committed wasm, relative to the config file.
- The **query keys** (`highlightsQuery`, `injectionsQuery`, `indentsQuery`, `foldsQuery`, `tagsQuery`, `localsQuery`, and optional `parseBoundariesQuery`) point at `.scm` files. A key may hold an array; the files are concatenated in order, which lets grammars share a common base query. Query files may contain the `._LANG_` token, which is replaced with the config's `treeSitter.languageSegment` — this is how one query file serves both TypeScript and TSX.

Several configs can share one wasm (JSON, JSONC, and Jupyter). Configs that pin the same `parserSource` and wasm filename always move together.

## Building a parser wasm

A parser is compiled from the exact source in `parserSource` with the `tree-sitter-cli` version pinned by `lem` and the WASI SDK and Binaryen versions pinned by that CLI. In the flat Lumine workspace, `lem grammar` owns that workflow: it reuses its ignored source checkout, validates the result against the editor's `web-tree-sitter`, installs every copy in the same parser family, and updates `wasmBuildTool`.

```sh
lem grammar language-json/grammars/json.json
lem grammar language-json/grammars/json.json --source github:tree-sitter/tree-sitter-json#v0.24.8 --diff-node-types
lem grammar --check
```

The first form rebuilds the currently pinned source. The second changes `parserSource` and reports added and removed node types and fields. The builder generates `parser.c` automatically when upstream ships none; use `--regenerate` only for a targeted parser migration followed by real parse tests, because generator changes can alter behavior even when named node types and fields do not change. `--check` performs no build; it verifies every committed wasm's ABI and recorded CLI version.

`lem` keeps every isolated source clone, including `lumine-code` parsers, at `.parsers/<repo_owner>_<repo_name>` and build products in `.wasms/`, both ignored by Git. Tree-sitter caches its pinned WASI SDK and Binaryen separately in the platform cache; `TREE_SITTER_WASI_SDK_PATH` and `TREE_SITTER_BINARYEN_PATH` may point to existing toolchain checkouts. The current fleet CLI is the exact `tree-sitter-cli` dependency in `lem`.

`parserSource` and `wasmBuildTool` are the committed provenance. Do not copy a wasm by hand: `lem grammar` fans a build out to every config with the same source and wasm name, including copies in different package repositories, so shared parsers do not drift.

Builds are reproducible: the same source ref and CLI version produce a byte-identical wasm. If a bump produces identical bytes, the commit is just a re-pin — that is normal for upstream releases that only touch bindings.

### Grammars outside the Lumine repository

A grammar package does not have to be bundled with the editor. It may be pinned in the editor's dependencies and delivered through `node_modules`, or installed from the catalog. In the flat workspace `lem grammar --all` and `--check` already see every sibling grammar package; when given one config path, the command also includes that config's owning package automatically.

The editor's query and capture gates deliberately default to its bundled set so CI has stable membership. Widen those checks explicitly for an unpinned checkout: the capture check takes a repeatable `--package-root`, and the query-compilation spec reads `LUMINE_GRAMMAR_PACKAGE_ROOTS`, a `PATH`-style variable:

```sh
npm run check:grammar-captures -- --package-root ../language-lua
LUMINE_GRAMMAR_PACKAGE_ROOTS=../language-lua npm run test:only -- spec/grammar-query-validation-spec.js
```

When writing queries, inspect `src/node-types.json` and upstream `queries/` in the source clone that `lem grammar` keeps under the build cache rather than fetching another copy.

While authoring queries, do not iterate through the pin. Symlink the package into `~/.lumine/packages-dev`, which is searched ahead of the bundled checkout, so the editor loads your working copy and a query change needs no repin, no reinstall, and no commit.

## Updating a grammar

Check the upstream sources declared by the grammar configs before choosing an update:

```sh
lem upstream --parsers
lem upstream --parsers --all
```

This scan groups shared parser pins, uses the source checkouts under `lem/.parsers`, and compares each immutable pin with its upstream default branch. It reports changes to authored grammars, scanners and queries separately from generated parser files and repository tooling. Review those changes against Lumine's own queries and fixtures; a newer upstream commit alone does not establish that a parser update is useful.

1. Run `lem grammar <config> --source github:org/repo#ref --diff-node-types` with the new tag or SHA.
2. Read the diff: **removed** node types or fields are the breakage forecast — search the grammar's `.scm` files for each one. Renames surface as query compile errors; _shape_ changes (a node moving inside another) also surface as compile errors even when the inventory is unchanged.
3. Run the three gates from the Lumine repo. A language package lives in its own repository, so its specs run against a real build rather than through `test:only`:

   ```sh
   LUMINE_GRAMMAR_PACKAGE_ROOTS=../language-json npm run test:only -- spec/grammar-query-validation-spec.js
   npm run check:grammar-captures -- --package-root ../language-json
   npm start -- --test ../language-json/spec
   ```

4. Eyeball highlighting, indentation, and folding on a real file — `spec/fixtures/sample.*` exists for exactly this.
5. Run `lem grammar --check`, then commit the wasm, config and query fixes together, one grammar per commit.
6. Push the package first. If it is bundled, use `lem repin` to advance the editor and every dependent pin in dependency order; never substitute a SHA by hand in a lockfile.

## Query validation and errors

Every query of every bundled grammar is compiled in CI by `spec/grammar-query-validation-spec.js`, so a broken query cannot ship silently — even for a language package with no spec suite of its own. It enumerates the dependencies whose manifests declare `engines.lumine` rather than reading `packages/`, so it covers grammars delivered through `node_modules/` too, and `LUMINE_GRAMMAR_PACKAGE_ROOTS` adds checkouts that are not pinned yet.

A grammar package in its own repository carries the same gate as a spec of its own, `spec/grammar-queries-spec.js`, which compiles every query its configs declare against its committed wasm. It needs no CI change: the package's existing integration job already runs its specs inside a real Lumine build. Without it such a package has **no** query gate at all, and a broken highlights query does not fail its other specs — the language layer degrades to a placeholder, so everything stays green while highlighting is silently dead.

The scaffolder described in [Creating a grammar](creating-a-grammar.md) emits that spec with the rest of a new package repository.

### Captures that compile but are not scopes

Compiling is not the whole story. A capture left with the name an upstream Neovim query gave it — `@tag.delimiter`, `@spell`, `@embedded` — compiles, and it matches. Every gate above passes. The scope simply is not a TextMate scope, so it themes as nothing and no scope selector can see it, and the only symptom is a token that stays grey.

`npm run check:grammar-captures` is the gate for that, and it runs in the lint job. A capture whose first segment is not one of the TextMate roots (`comment`, `constant`, `entity`, `invalid`, `keyword`, `markup`, `meta`, `punctuation`, `source`, `storage`, `string`, `support`, `text`, `variable`) fails the build; `_IGNORE_` and `_IGNORE_.…` are exempt, which is how a helper capture used only as a predicate operand says it is not a scope.

It also warns about a capture carrying no language segment. The segment is read off the queries — the one a majority of the captures already end in, per file and then per package — rather than derived from the scope name, which is wrong for `text.html.basic`, `source.json.jsonc`, `source.makefile` and `source.python.ipy`. A segment anywhere in the capture counts, not just last: `meta.diff.header` is the name the TextMate diff bundle fixed a decade ago and the tree-sitter grammar has to match its own TextMate twin, so a second `.diff` would be the wrong fix. That check warns rather than failing the build, because the next such family will not be knowable in advance and gating on it would mean keeping an allowlist.

Only `highlightsQuery` is checked. The other query types have vocabularies of their own (`@fold`, `@indent`, `@name`, `@local.scope`), so measuring them against scope names would say nothing. Use `--package-root` to include a checkout that is not pinned yet.

A query that fails to compile does **not** break the grammar: the editor still activates it, parses, and reports the error precisely — the query type, the offending `.scm` file and line, and the unknown node type or field name when there is one. In dev mode the error also appears as a notification, and query files are watched: saving a broken query beeps and reports, saving a fixed one hot-reloads it.

Two commands help while working on queries:

- `editor:validate-grammar-queries` — recompiles every query of the grammars used by the current buffer (including injected ones) and reports each failure.
- `editor:log-cursor-scope` — shows the scopes at the cursor, for checking what a query actually applied.

Mistakes inside predicates are contained the same way: an unknown `test.`/`adjust.`/`capture.` key, an invalid regular expression, or a predicate missing its argument drops only the affected capture and warns once per grammar in dev mode, instead of breaking highlighting for the whole file.

## Static injections

Declare `treeSitter.injectionsQuery` when a syntax pattern can identify an injection's owner, content and language without a JavaScript callback. Keep the query beside the grammar's other assets, for example `grammars/example-injections.scm`, and reference it as `"injectionsQuery": "example-injections.scm"`. The query is compiled against the same parser as highlighting, validated by the query gates, and watched and reloaded in dev mode.

Each pattern must capture exactly one `@injection.owner` and at least one `@injection.content`. The owner defines the range used for local rediscovery and layer reuse; the content defines what the child parser receives. Every content capture, language capture and helper capture used by predicates must lie within that owner. Choose a local owner that contains the fragments belonging to one injection, rather than the file's root node.

For example, a parser whose documentation comments use `///` can inject them into a grammar whose alias is `documentation`:

```scheme
((comment) @injection.owner @injection.content
  (#match? @injection.owner "^///")
  (#set! injection.language "documentation")
  (#set! injection.include-children "true")
  (#set! injection.combined "true")
  (#set! injection.newlines-between "true"))
```

The child grammar must accept the captured source, including its delimiters. To select the language from source, capture one node as `@injection.language` instead of setting `injection.language`; that node's text is resolved through the target grammar's `injectionNames` aliases. Use JavaScript when selection needs normalization, configuration, semantic checks or source ranges that the syntax tree does not represent.

| Property | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `injection.language` | A fixed injection alias, used instead of `@injection.language`. |
| `injection.include-children` | Include each content node's child nodes in the parsed source. By default, direct children are excluded. |
| `injection.include-adjacent-whitespace` | Include whitespace between captured content ranges. |
| `injection.newlines-between` | Include newline joins between captured content ranges. |
| `injection.combined` | Share one child document across owners from the same pattern and language. |
| `injection.combined-max-members` | Bound a combined layer to this positive safe integer number of owners. |
| `injection.language-scope` | Override the child grammar's base scope; `"none"` suppresses it. |
| `injection.cover-shallower-scopes` | Cover scopes supplied by shallower language layers. |

Boolean properties accept `"true"`, `"false"`, or a directive without a value, which means true. Unknown properties and captures beginning with `injection.`, custom predicates and directives, and `#is?` or `#is-not?` assertions fail validation. The implemented text predicates are `#eq?`, `#not-eq?`, `#any-eq?`, `#any-not-eq?`, `#match?`, `#not-match?`, `#any-match?`, `#any-not-match?`, `#any-of?` and `#not-any-of?`. A pattern cannot combine a fixed language property with a language capture.

Matches from the same pattern, owner and language accumulate content fragments into one injection. The runtime deduplicates repeated captures across scan windows and preserves each pattern's identity for layer reuse. Separate patterns remain separate injections, even when they capture the same owner and select the same language. `combined` then groups these owners using the same range and parser lifecycle as JavaScript injection points; a member limit counts owners, rather than content fragments.

Static queries and `lumine.grammars.addInjectionPoint()` registrations are additive. Port a rule by removing its JavaScript registration when its query is ready, so both mechanisms do not create the same child document. Keep dynamic registrations for configuration changes, semantic eligibility checks and synthetic content ranges, and dispose them with the package or service edge that owns them. Removing or reloading a static query rebuilds its injections without removing unrelated dynamic registrations.

An injection target can declare a top-level `injectionContentRegex` in its grammar descriptor when a cheap text check can rule out owners that have nothing for it to parse:

```json
{
  "scopeName": "text.hyperlink",
  "injectionNames": ["hyperlink"],
  "injectionContentRegex": "\\bhttps?:"
}
```

The value is a nonempty regular-expression string or a nonempty array of such strings, treated as alternatives. An omitted or null value accepts every structurally eligible match; empty, invalid or malformed filters fail grammar loading. The runtime compiles the filter once and tests each static match's owner text before creating a child layer. Owner text includes the content captures, their children and any gaps between them, so the filter conservatively accepts matches whose actual content might not contain a token. This also avoids losing a token that crosses capture boundaries. Declare only a filter that cannot reject source the target parser should handle; JavaScript injection points keep their existing callback-controlled eligibility.

`language-hyperlink` and `language-todo` own their respective filters. A parent grammar selects their aliases without copying URL expressions or the TODO marker list, consuming a service, or defining a JavaScript entry point:

```scheme
((comment) @injection.owner @injection.content
  (#set! injection.language "hyperlink")
  (#set! injection.include-children)
  (#set! injection.language-scope "none"))

((comment) @injection.owner @injection.content
  (#set! injection.language "todo")
  (#set! injection.include-children)
  (#set! injection.language-scope "none"))
```

Use the parent parser's actual comment types and keep document-comment exclusions or URL-specific structural guards in its query. Including children preserves comment bodies represented by child nodes; for strings, capture literal content nodes and leave expressions out. For annotation patterns, give each independent literal fragment its own owner and content capture: joining fragments in one layer can let a lexer token span an excluded expression. When an injection target is unavailable, the editor retains the unresolved alias; grammar registration retries it, and grammar removal rebuilds the affected injections. The JavaScript services remain supported for rules requiring runtime logic.

The [C# grammar](https://github.com/lumine-code/language-csharp) uses these annotation patterns for `comment` nodes and selects `string_literal_content` for hyperlinks in ordinary string literals. TODO markers stay limited to comments. Raw, verbatim, and interpolated strings have different syntax nodes; inspect the parent parser before extending a literal-content pattern to those forms.

The performance benefit comes from structural selection in the query and fewer node accesses across the JavaScript/WASM boundary. Text predicates still run in JavaScript in `web-tree-sitter`, and every selected child document still needs range markers, reconciliation and parsing. Measure initial opening and incremental edits separately; changing the query format alone does not reduce the number of child layers.

Run `npm run test:only -- benchmark/tree-sitter-static-injections-spec.js` from the editor repository for a diagnostic comparison of equivalent JavaScript and static rules. It measures initial parsing with warm languages and queries, edits inside content and prefix shifts, and verifies owner ranges, content, syntax trees, scopes and layer counts outside the timers. It reports samples and medians without performance thresholds; set `LUMINE_STATIC_INJECTION_BENCHMARK_CONFIG` to a JSON object with `sizes`, `samples` and `warmups` to change the workload.

## Keeping grammar work local

### Optional incremental parse boundaries

A grammar that divides opaque text into bounded fragments can declare `parseBoundariesQuery` to preserve their alignment after edits that shift the fragment boundaries, including insertion of a physical newline. The scanner must recognize adjacent included-range starts as permitted fragment ends. This is an opt-in parser capability: a scanner that treats every included-range start as a separate language region must not enable it.

```json
{
  "treeSitter": {
    "grammar": "ipython.wasm",
    "parseBoundariesQuery": "ipython-parse-boundaries.scm"
  }
}
```

```scheme
(cell_body "opaque_fragment" @parse.boundary)
```

After applying `tree.edit()`, the editor reads the selected fragments' updated end indices and positions. It passes sparse adjacent included ranges to the root parser so the edited prefix can end at an existing fragment boundary and the remaining tree can be reused. The ranges cover exactly the same source as before; language ownership and injection ranges retain their semantic boundaries. The editor rejects boundaries inside UTF-16 pairs or CRLF and removes duplicate or nearby cuts. Injected parsers do not receive these root-parser hints.

For grammars with fragment groups containing many line nodes, `treeSitter.parseBoundariesMaxStartDepth` can limit the initial query traversal. A safe integer from 0 through 32 is accepted and passed as Tree-sitter's `maxStartDepth`; an absent or invalid value leaves the query unrestricted. The shallow query must capture each group as `@parse.boundary`. The editor expands captured groups that have changes and children recursively, querying each group with `maxStartDepth` set to the configured value plus one, with a minimum of one. It merges and deduplicates captures while descending only into changed captured groups, so boundaries inside an edited long line remain available while unchanged groups avoid a full descendant traversal. Each intermediate group must therefore appear within that relative depth and be captured by the query. An anonymous visible group node provides this traversal boundary while retaining its nested named line nodes; clients that previously read lines directly from a paragraph must account for that group.

The query is loaded before parsing and participates in query validation and reloads. It should select bounded fragments whose boundaries the scanner can use, rather than every token in the document. Verify fresh and incremental syntax, complete source coverage, injections, and edits near fragment and Unicode boundaries. Parser bindings used outside the editor need to pass equivalent alignment options when reparsing an old tree; the IPython binding exposes a helper for this purpose.

Repeated edits can create short fragments between surviving boundaries. The editor consolidates dense runs with bounded metadata-only invalidations before reparsing; it changes no source text, coordinates, or language ownership. This keeps fragment collection and reuse costs stable over a long editing session.

### Parser and query costs

Measure opening a file, editing a small range, and collecting symbols separately. A fast parser does not guarantee a fast grammar: query compilation, repeated sibling matches, and injection callbacks can dominate different phases. Use valid generated input as well as partially edited syntax, and compare captures and scopes before and after an optimization.

The first parse waits for the highlighting query and any declared injection query. Folding and indentation queries already in the grammar cache are reused immediately; cold queries are prepared during idle time after the first highlighting update. An explicit folding or indentation request prepares the query when needed, and completed folding queries invalidate the initial fold cache so gutter markers appear without an edit. Symbol and local-variable queries are compiled on their first asynchronous capture request. Changed optional queries stay uncompiled until requested; queries already in use retain validation and reload behavior. The validation command and CI still compile every declared query.

Upstream Tree-sitter query construction remains synchronous, so a large cold highlights query can still briefly occupy the renderer.

Prefer a field or a leaf pattern to an unbounded sibling sequence. A query containing `(comment)*` before a declaration can reconsider long suffixes even when the caller requests only a small row window. Capture definitions and names directly when documentation is not consumed; when a sequence is required, test its behavior inside a growing parent rather than only on a short fixture.

An injection callback should inspect the node that owns its content. Registering a root node and calling `descendantsOfType` inside the callback performs synchronous work on the entire tree after every edit. The runtime's outer scan budget cannot divide a traversal inside a callback.

Use `combined` when several discovered nodes contribute to one logical child document:

```js
const registration = lumine.grammars.addInjectionPoint("source.example", {
  type: "documentation_line",
  language: () => "documentation",
  content: (node) => node,
  combined: true,
  newlinesBetween: true,
});
```

The child layer shares its parser and queries while retaining individual owner and content ranges. An edit outside those ranges does not rediscover every member. `combined` can also be a function receiving the owner node: return `false` to parse that owner's content independently when joining it would change its meaning or its error recovery. Dispose the registration with the package or service edge that created it. Test malformed syntax as well as insertion, deletion, prefix shifts, and removal of the last member.

When independent owners are safe to combine but a large shared parse tree makes local edits expensive, set `combinedMaxMembers` to a positive safe integer. For example, validated regex literals can share layers with at most 128 owners each. Existing owners keep their group during ordinary edits; insertion and deletion split or merge neighboring groups when needed. Each owner counts once even if its `content` function returns several nodes, and those fragments stay together. Omit the limit when the regions require one continuous document, such as the SassDoc example above. Test scopes across group boundaries, changes in eligibility and flags, prefix shifts, and grammar replacement before enabling a limit.

For grammar-selection regular expressions, make repeated alternatives disjoint. A comment matcher must stop at the first closing delimiter; an optional whitespace matcher must not overlap another repeated whitespace branch. Include failed matches in regression cases: the costly backtracking often appears when the final language name or opening delimiter is absent.

## Recognizing unopened files

Use `await lumine.grammars.selectGrammarAsync(filePath, { signal })` when background work needs the language of a file that is not open. It reads the file asynchronously once, applies the same filename and content rules as `selectGrammar`, and accepts an `AbortSignal` so a package can cancel work during teardown. For an open editor, use `editor.getGrammar()` to preserve a manual language selection.

The synchronous `selectGrammar(filePath, fileContents)` remains available when the caller already has the text. Passing the contents avoids disk access; omitting them reads the file synchronously once. Both selectors honor custom file types, shebangs, multiline first-line expressions and content expressions. A package awaiting a result must still verify that its document, configuration and package generation are current before applying it.

## Constraining an embedded editor's root language

A host can keep a prefix in an editor's buffer while parsing only its body with the selected language. `lumine.grammars.setRootLanguageRanges(buffer, provider)` installs a policy for that buffer's root language without changing its source text or its assigned grammar. Notebook code cells use this for a visible `%%` header followed by a body parsed with its original language package.

The provider runs synchronously before each parse and receives the buffer. Return an array of `Range` objects in buffer coordinates, `null` to parse the whole buffer, or `[]` to parse no source. For a host-defined prefix occupying the first line:

```js
const { Range } = require("lumine");

const registration = lumine.grammars.setRootLanguageRanges(editor.getBuffer(), (buffer) => {
  if (!buffer.lineForRow(0).startsWith("%%")) return null;
  return [new Range(buffer.clipPosition([1, 0]), buffer.getEndPosition())];
});
```

The policy follows the buffer across grammar changes. It is not serialized, so the host recreates it when restoring its editor. Dispose the returned registration when the host releases the buffer; disposing an older registration does not remove a newer policy. Source outside the included ranges stays editable and is still available to save, copy, search, and execution. The host owns any highlighting or decorations for that excluded prefix.

Keep the provider small: use bounded prefix recognition and edit-aware markers or caches instead of rescanning a large body on every parse. The ranges constrain syntax parsing, not the code sent to a kernel or language server; those consumers still need their own source contract.

## ABI compatibility

A parser wasm carries the ABI version of the `tree-sitter-cli` that generated its `parser.c`. Rebuilding an existing `parser.c` preserves that ABI; `lem grammar --regenerate` replaces it with output from the fleet CLI. Lumine's runtime accepts a window of ABI versions (currently 13–15), so a wasm outside that window must not be committed. If an upstream commits sources generated with an incompatible CLI, run `lem grammar <config> --regenerate` so the parser is regenerated at an ABI the runtime accepts.
