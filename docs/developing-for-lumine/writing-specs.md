# Writing specs

Lumine and its packages are tested with **specs** — Jasmine-based tests that run inside a real editor window, so they can exercise the actual editor API.

## Where specs live

Put specs in your package's `spec/` directory, named `*-spec.js` (or `*-spec.jsx` for a spec that itself contains JSX). A spec uses the familiar Jasmine structure and has the full `lumine` API available:

```js
describe("my-package", () => {
  it("greets", async () => {
    await lumine.packages.activatePackage("my-package");
    lumine.commands.dispatch(
      lumine.views.getView(lumine.workspace),
      "my-package:hello",
    );
    expect(lumine.notifications.getNotifications().length).toBe(1);
  });
});
```

## Waiting

A spec body that takes no argument is awaited, so `async () => {}` is all most specs need. When you have to wait for something that is not a promise you hold, the runner puts four waiters on the global — no import:

| Waiter                                              | Use it for                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flushMicrotasks(count)`                            | a promise chain with no timer in it. Cheapest, and it cannot hang.      |
| `waitForFrames(condition, { frames })`              | something that needs a paint: a rendered view, a measurement, a scroll. |
| `conditionPromise(condition, description, timeout)` | real I/O — a subprocess, a file watcher, a network round trip.          |
| `timeoutPromise(ms)`                                | a fixed pause on the real clock.                                        |

The catch is that **the runner freezes time**: `setTimeout`, `setInterval` and `Date.now` are all faked, so `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10))` never resolves. Advance the fake clock with `advanceClock(ms)` when the code under test schedules its own timer, or call `jasmine.useRealClock()` as the first line of a `beforeEach` when it genuinely needs wall time. The waiters above already reach past the fake clock.

Never combine `async` with Jasmine's `done` argument. A spec body that declares any parameter is handed `done` and is _not_ awaited, so a rejection inside it hangs the spec instead of failing it.

## Running specs

- **From the editor** — open your package and run `window:run-package-specs` to run its `spec/` suite in a dedicated window.
- **From the command line** — run a suite headlessly by pointing the `lumine` command at it:

  ```sh
  lumine --test spec/my-feature-spec.js
  lumine --test spec           # run the whole directory
  ```

  Every `lumine-code` package repository exposes the second form as `npm test`, so a fresh clone needs no further setup. The run exits with the suite's status code, and it loads the editor from the source checkout named by `LUMINE_RESOURCE_PATH` — see [Launching Lumine](../getting-started/launching-lumine.md) — or from the installed build when that variable is unset.

## Tips

- Activate the package under test explicitly (`lumine.packages.activatePackage`) rather than assuming it is loaded.
- Dispatch commands through `lumine.commands.dispatch` against the right view to test behavior the way a user triggers it.
- Keep specs isolated — undo any config or workspace changes, since specs share one editor environment.
