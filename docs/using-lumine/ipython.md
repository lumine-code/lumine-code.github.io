# IPython and Jupyter cells

An `.ipy` file combines Python, IPython commands, and named cells in one source document. Install [`language-ipython`](https://github.com/lumine-code/language-ipython) for syntax highlighting, [`jupyter-cells`](https://github.com/lumine-code/jupyter-cells) for cell navigation and notebook conversion, and [`jupyter-repl`](https://github.com/lumine-code/jupyter-repl) to run code through a Jupyter kernel. Install these packages from **Settings → Install**. Add [`jupyter-view`](https://github.com/lumine-code/jupyter-view) to edit `.ipynb` files as notebooks.

`tree-sitter-ipython` parses the cell scaffold and IPython commands. `language-ipython` injects the original Python grammar into Python bodies, sharing one Python layer across the document, and the corresponding original grammars into Markdown and foreign magic bodies. The scaffold does not duplicate Python syntax. Cell markers belong to the scaffold and are styled as comments; raw and unknown bodies stay plain text.

The body-language rules live in `ipython-injections.scm`. An IPython command excludes its entire row from the shared Python syntax tree, splitting the surrounding source into fragments. Those fragments remain combined in one Python layer. Executable magic payloads receive separate syntax injections. Assignment magics exclude the whole assignment row rather than leaving an incomplete Python expression; the shared analysis projection separately retains the assignment name and replaces only its IPython RHS.

## Writing a cell document

Start each cell with a column-zero `# %%` marker. Text after the marker is its title. Additional `%` characters are accepted in document cell markers. Python before the first marker is an initial code cell.

The optional [`navigation-panel`](https://github.com/lumine-code/navigation-panel) keeps its own annotations: `#%%$# Section` creates a cell entry and `#%%$$# Child` adds a child entry. The number of `$` characters controls the outline level. Ordinary document markers such as `# %% Title` or `# %% [markdown] Notes` do not create navigation-panel entries. The IPython parser accepts compact navigation annotations without changing their syntax.

```ipy
# %% Setup
directory = %pwd
files = !ls

# %% [markdown] Notes
# Analysis
Write **Markdown** literally, including headings and lists.

# %% [raw] Payload
Keep this text exactly as written: <tag> { unclosed

# %% Results
values = [1, 2, 3]
sum(values)
```

`[markdown]` and `[md]` select Markdown; `[raw]` selects raw. `[code]` explicitly selects code. The bare spellings `markdown`, `md`, and `raw` are code-cell titles. Metadata is case-sensitive and must be the first complete word after the percent run. A title such as `markdownish benchmark` is a code-cell title.

Markdown and raw bodies are literal source. A Markdown heading is `# Analysis`, without an extra Python comment prefix. Raw text keeps its `#` characters and is neither executed nor rendered as Markdown. Running a Markdown cell renders it locally without starting a kernel; running raw cells skips them.

Markers inside Python strings, bracketed expressions, continued expressions, or indented suites do not split cells. In a literal Markdown, raw, or foreign-language body, a column-zero `# %%` line is reserved as the next cell boundary. Indent that line when you intend it as body text.

Use `jupyter-cells:run-cell`, `jupyter-cells:run-cell-and-move-down`, or `jupyter-cells:run-all` to execute cells. The package also provides commands to select, reorder, navigate, and fold cells.

## Cell magics

A cell magic starts with `%%` on the first nonblank line of a code cell. Its arguments stay on that header line, and its body continues to the next cell marker or the end of the file. Put a new marker before a cell magic that follows other code or a comment.

```ipy
# %% Timing
%%timeit -n 3
sum(range(1000))

# %% Shell
%%bash -x
echo hello

# %% HTML
%%html --isolated
<h1>Results</h1>
```

`time`, `timeit`, `prun`, `debug`, `capture`, and `code_wrap` keep Python syntax. Known foreign magics use the corresponding installed language grammar: shell for `bash`, `sh`, `sx`, `system`, and `!`; HTML for `html` and `HTML`; Markdown for `markdown`; LaTeX for `latex`; JavaScript for `javascript` and `js`; XML for `svg` and `SVG`; Perl and Ruby for their names. `python`, `python2`, `python3`, and `pypy` bodies use the original Python grammar. Names are case-sensitive. `script`, `writefile`, `file`, `cmd`, and unknown magics retain a plain body.

Running at the cursor inside a cell magic runs the whole magic. When you run a selected fragment of its body, the execution packages prepend the complete original header, including arguments. For example, selecting only `echo hello` in the shell example still submits it with `%%bash -x`.

Line commands such as `%pwd`, shell escapes such as `!ls`, and assignment results such as `directory = %pwd` remain IPython syntax within code cells.

Line magics highlight only their `%` prefix and command name as a magic command. `%time`, `%timeit`, `%prun`, `%debug`, and `%config` use Python highlighting for the code after their leading options. For example, `%timeit -n 3 prs.nodes_dissup(151)` keeps `%timeit` as the command, `-n 3` as arguments, and `prs.nodes_dissup(151)` as Python. Nested magic commands and shell escapes keep their IPython highlighting. `%%timeit` setup code and optional header statements in `%%prun` and `%%debug` also use Python syntax. Paths, object-name patterns, history ranges, and arguments to other or custom line magics remain text.

## Notebook syntax and execution

An `.ipynb` notebook stores each cell's type separately from its source. `jupyter-view` uses the original language package for a code cell, the Markdown package for a Markdown cell, and plain syntax for raw. A Python notebook cell containing `# %% [markdown]` remains a code cell; the comment does not change its stored type or divide it into source-file cells.

For a leading cell magic, the notebook keeps the header visible and parses the body with its original language grammar. A manual grammar choice takes precedence and is saved in the cell's language metadata. The body's selected grammar governs its highlighting, including whether it understands the kernel's extended syntax.

Syntax and kernel choice are separate. A cell with `%%bash` can be highlighted as shell while being submitted to the notebook's Python kernel, which handles the magic. Selecting HTML or Python syntax does not start a different kernel or convert a code cell into Markdown or raw.

## Inspecting results and data

`jupyter-repl` also contains the kernel monitor and command prompt. The monitor lists every running kernel and offers interrupt, restart, and shutdown. Each prompt run submits code to the session selected for its current context.

With `hyperclick` active, holding Alt over a traceback location offers navigation to an existing local source file or to the source captured for an executed cell. Plain hover and click keep normal text behavior; Alt-click follows the verified destination, with the same hover delay as source symbols. Library frames can be folded. Notebook links follow stable cell IDs through reordering; changing or deleting the executed source disables its link until it is run again. Syntax errors select the reported source range when the kernel supplies one.

`jupyter-explorer` reads dataframes and arrays in pages from the kernel, with sorting, filtering, search and column profiles over the full selected data. Column histograms and frequent values can apply filters together. Charts use an explicitly labelled bounded sample. The package can also open Parquet, Feather and Arrow files when the kernel environment has the required readers.

`jupyter-repl` renders interactive Matplotlib figures with `%matplotlib ipympl` and custom anywidget modules in isolated frames. Install `ipympl` or `anywidget` in the kernel environment first. Bokeh's `output_notebook()` and Panel's `pn.extension()` select their notebook renderers; their resource scripts and browser callbacks run inside isolated output frames. Python callbacks require the original kernel to remain connected.

## AI access through MCP

`jupyter-inspector` shows documentation for an expression, `jupyter-variables` browses and edits a Python namespace, and `jupyter-watches` re-evaluates selected expressions after execution. Watches keep their expressions and retained run history when the output renderer is replaced; reopening the panel recreates its editors around the same live-kernel models. See [Jupyter services and lifecycle](../developing-for-lumine/jupyter-services.md) for the shared API and resource ownership.

With `lumine-mcp` active and a client connected to this window, the Jupyter packages expose notebook, kernel, execution, variable and watch tools. Reads use the live notebook, including unsaved cell source. Edits preserve notebook undo and require the revision returned by a read. Execution names an existing kernel and returns a receipt that can be queried without running the code again; repeated requests with the same operation ID do not duplicate accepted work.

The host can wait for notebook changes or execution progress while other calls remain available. Cancelling an observation releases its listener without stopping Python; interrupt and restart are separate actions. Variable and watch reads expose existing cached data and identify stale or unavailable values. See the [Jupyter MCP workflow](https://github.com/lumine-code/lumine-mcp/blob/master/docs/jupyter.md) for tool names and request fields.

## Python analysis tools

Use `ide` with `ide-basedpyright` for static Python analysis and navigation. `symbol:go-to-definition` opens definitions, `find-references:show-panel` lists usages, and `refactor:rename` renames through the server. Install the corresponding `symbol`, `find-references`, and `refactor` frontend packages; `hyperclick` adds pointer navigation through `symbol`.

`ide-basedpyright` and `ide-ruff` use a shared Python projection supplied by `language-ipython`. Each tool receives one Python module for the entire file, so imports and names remain visible across cells. Python code cells and Python magic bodies participate in analysis. Markdown, raw, and foreign magic bodies are masked, including Python fences written inside a Markdown cell. IPython commands are replaced with valid analysis placeholders while preserving source positions. The kernel continues to receive the original source when you execute it.

The projection maps diagnostic, lookup, and edit positions back to the source document, including Unicode columns. Requests inside excluded regions return no Python results. Returned edits are checked against their source revision and cannot overwrite protected cell headers or foreign bodies. Ruff uses one formatter request and restores the original IPython commands and surrounding non-Python source before applying edits.

IPython commands remain runtime operations. Static analysis cannot discover names created dynamically by commands such as `%run`; write normal Python imports or annotations when the analyzer needs that information. Basedpyright analyzes explicitly opened `.ipy` documents, but its normal workspace discovery and Python module imports do not treat closed `.ipy` files as `.py` modules.

`ide-ruff:lint-projects` and `ide-ruff:lint-selected` include `.ipy` files through the same safe projection. Open documents use their current buffers; closed files use temporary source snapshots. The scans report diagnostics without rewriting files.

## Importing and exporting notebooks

`jupyter-cells:import-notebook` opens a notebook as a source document. For a Python notebook, it creates literal `.ipy` code, Markdown, and raw cells and suggests an `.ipy` filename when you save. Saved results can appear inline when `jupyter-repl` is available. Other notebook languages retain their language's comment-prefixed non-code cells.

`jupyter-cells:export-notebook` writes the source document as an `.ipynb` notebook with code, Markdown, and raw cell types. Export does not require a running kernel; when one is available, its specification supplies the notebook's kernel metadata.

Marker headers are structure rather than cell source. One newline before the next marker separates cells and is excluded from the exported source. Additional trailing newlines belong to the preceding cell and are preserved. For example, leave a blank line before the next marker when the cell's source must end with a newline. Empty explicit cells remain cells, and the final cell keeps its source through the end of the file. Literal `.ipy` descriptors and imported or exported notebook sources preserve CRLF, lone CR and LF exactly, including literal `#` prefixes. When a source ends in a lone CR, import uses a CRLF separator before the next marker to keep that source CR intact. Execution blocks normalize line endings to LF.
