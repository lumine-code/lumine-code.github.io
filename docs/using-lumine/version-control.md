# Version control

Lumine has built-in repository support and bundles `git-diff`; additional Git interfaces are optional packages.

## Diff markers in the gutter

The **`git-diff`** package marks lines in the editor gutter that have been added, edited, or deleted since the last commit. You can:

- move between changes with `git-diff:move-to-next-diff` and `git-diff:move-to-previous-diff`, and
- open a searchable list of every change in the file with `git-diff:toggle-diff-list`.

The markers can be shown as colored icons or colored gutter marks — choose in the package's settings.

## Reverting changes

The editor can revert an uncommitted change back to what is committed: `editor:checkout-head-revision` restores the block at the cursor to its `HEAD` revision.

## Status indicators

The tree view and tabs color file names by Git status. `git:colorize-toggle` switches the coloring for the current window. The bundled `language-git` grammar highlights Git files such as commit messages and rebase todo lists.

## The repository, branch, and worktree tiles

Install **`git-center`** to show the active repository, working-tree counts, and branch in the status bar. On the left side, the repository and branch appear before the linter counters. Its filterable pickers are also available through `git-center:select-repository` and `git-center:select-branch`.

The active repository normally follows whatever you are editing. `git-center:toggle-lock` pins it in place so it stops following, and the repository picker's `Auto` row hands it back.

### Worktrees

A Git worktree is another checkout of the repository. `git-center:select-worktree` lists worktrees and opens one in this window; its actions can open one elsewhere, create, move, lock, unlock, or remove it. The branch picker marks branches checked out in another worktree and offers to open that checkout.

## Commit attribution

Install **`git-blame`** and run `git-blame:toggle` to show who last changed the lines in the current file. Consecutive lines from the same commit share one gutter block, with the hash, date and author shown once; its label stays visible while scrolling through a long block. Wrapped lines stay inside their block, and uncommitted lines are grouped and marked as such. Hover over a block for the commit message, or click anywhere in it to open the commit on its Git host; when no host link is available, the click copies its hash.

## Opening on your Git host

The **`open-repository`** package opens the current file or repository on its Git host's website. Install it from the Install pane in **Settings**, or with `lumine --install lumine-code/open-repository`. It supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket (and falls back to GitHub-style URLs for other hosts). Run `open-repository:file` to open the file, its blame or history, the repository, its issues or pull/merge requests, or the branch compare page; run `open-repository:copy-url` to copy a URL for the current file and selected lines.

## Going further

For richer workflows, install these `lumine-code` packages from the Install tab (see [The package system](../packages-and-themes/package-system.md)):

- **[git-command](https://github.com/lumine-code/git-command)** — searchable modal workflows for staging, commits, branches, remotes, history, and stashes.
- **[git-panel](https://github.com/lumine-code/git-panel)** — a full panel for changes, commits, branches, remotes, diffs, and conflicts.
- **[github-panel](https://github.com/lumine-code/github-panel)** — pull requests, reviews, issues, and repository publishing on top of `git-panel`.

In `git-panel`'s changes list, select one or more files and use **Split Up**, **Split Down**, **Split Left**, or **Split Right** in the context menu to open their working-tree contents in one new pane. The same actions are available as `git-panel:split-up`, `git-panel:split-down`, `git-panel:split-left`, and `git-panel:split-right` while the changes list has focus.

The `git-panel` diff viewer uses **Unified** by default, with removed and added lines shown together. Select **Side by Side** in the commit or changes header to compare the before and after versions in two aligned columns, with shared file headers and one scrollbar on the right; **Unified** returns to the original view. Switching layouts keeps the same location in the diff and the selected lines. Side by Side omits the caret's current-line highlight while retaining diff colors and explicit selections. File and hunk headers span the viewer width with matching margins and styling in both layouts. Both views are available for committed, unstaged, and staged changes. Long lines wrap by default, and toggling soft wrap in either column updates both columns.

`github-panel` provides the same layout switch in a pull request's **Files** tab and in diff previews beside review comments. Review previews keep the surrounding context limited to the comment's location and preserve source line numbering in either layout.

`git-command` provides the switch in **Diff Current File**, **Diff All**, and commit previews. Select **Staged Changes** or **Unstaged Changes** to compare the index and working-tree snapshots separately, even when the same file appears in both. The chosen snapshot and layout stay selected when an output pane is refreshed. Untracked files have a separate text preview. Keep `git-panel` enabled to use visual diffs; when it is unavailable, the report explains why and shows the text patch.

Type `lumine-code/git-command`, `lumine-code/git-panel`, or `lumine-code/github-panel` directly into the Install tab's search box to find them.
